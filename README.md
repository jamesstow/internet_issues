The code times out after 130s

You can see some form of repeating pattern in the errored requests (just over two minute intervals)

Code and captured data included. 

Any missing periods are when I stopped the script running

The request data was put into a database and I configured a grafana instance to look at it to view the data (grafana dashboard also included)
